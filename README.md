## How to add the Leeloo LXP Awesome Responsive Slider on your Moodle home page
You can add the Leeloo LXP Awesome Responsive Slider to any page theme with a { Content Region } (the center position on the page). If you want to use it on your Boost Home page (or any other theme that doesn’t include a { Content Region } for home page), you need to install the Leeloo LXP Content Filter.

## The Leeloo LXP Content Filter
The Leeloo LXP Content Filter allows you to use shortcodes on a page without a { Content Region } and display any of the Leeloo LXP Content Plugins from the Suite in the { Content Region }
